This summer I can hardly wait to go to the library.
Last year, I checked out this awesome book called
The <adjective> <noun> and the Great <color> <animal> .
It was so <adjective> that I ran over to my best friend’s
house to show her.  We laughed at the picture of the <adjective>
<different animal> !  I read the whole book in <number> hours! 
When I returned the book, I asked the librarian, Mr. <name of bug> -
<article of clothing> , for another one that was just as funny as the first one.
He gave me 10 books that he thought I’d really love.  
I also love going to the library to get movies and music.
My favorite movie from the library is <number>  <noun>
Go To the <fun place to visit> .  It has a great scene where the <plural noun>
go play <outdoor sport> in a <body of water> !  I wish I could do that, too. 
My favorite band is The <adjective> <type of lizard> and their new CD,
The Land of Oz, is great. I borrowed it from the library and listened to it every day.
My library has lots of great programs during the summer, too.
The best program that I went to taught me how to build a <thing> .
Mine turned out really well and I loved to <verb> my little brother around the <place> with it!
