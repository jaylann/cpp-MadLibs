The day I saw the Monkey King <verb> was one of the most
interesting days of the year. After he did that, 
the king played chess on his brother's
<noun> and then combed his <adjective> hair with a
comb made out of old fish bones. Later that same day, I saw the
Monkey King dance <adverb> in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.
